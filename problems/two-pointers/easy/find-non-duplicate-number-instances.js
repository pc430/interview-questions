/**
 * Given an array of sorted numbers, move all non-duplicate number instances at the beginning 
 * of the array in-place.The relative order of the elements should be kept the same and you 
 * should not use any extra space so that the solution has constant space complexity i.e., O(1).
 * 
 * Move all the unique number instances at the beginning of the array and after moving return the
 * length of the subarray that has no duplicate in it.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 9]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The first four elements after moving element will be [2, 3, 6, 9].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [2, 2, 2, 11]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The first two elements after moving elements will be [2, 11].

/**
 * Similar Problem:
 * Given an unsorted array of numbers and a target ‘key’, remove all instances of ‘key’ in-place 
 * and return the new length of the array.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [3, 2, 3, 6, 3, 10, 9, 3], Key=3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The first four elements after removing every 'Key' will be [2, 6, 10, 9].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [2, 11, 2, 2, 1], Key=2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The first two elements after removing every 'Key' will be [11, 1].
