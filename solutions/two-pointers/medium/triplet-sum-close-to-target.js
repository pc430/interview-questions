/**
 * Solution:
 * This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and is quite similar to Triplet Sum to Zero. We can follow a similar approach
 * to iterate through the array, taking one number at a time. At every step, we will save the difference between the triplet
 * and the target number, so that in the end, we can return the triplet with the closest sum.
 *
 * Time complexity
 * Sorting the array will take O(N* logN). Overall, the function will take O(N * logN + N^2), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2).
 *
 * Space complexity
 * The above algorithmâ€™s space complexity will be O(N), which is required for sorting.
